About Me
I bring over 5 years of experience as a Database Administrator, specializing in Oracle Databases, MongoDB, and MySQL, during my tenure at Deutsche Telekom. My career has evolved from traditional database operations into the dynamic realm of DevOps and DevSecOps, reflecting my adaptability and passion for growth.

In the early years, I focused on managing Oracle databases across diverse environments (AIX, Solaris, Linux) until Deutsche Telekom centralized its Oracle databases on the Oracle Exadata DBaaS platform. Later, I transitioned to a DevOps Engineer and Tech Lead role, where I led the team responsible for the MongoDB DBaaS platform on Open Telekom Cloud, powered by OpenStack. This role extended beyond database administration to encompass operating systems, storage, networking, automation, and more.

As part of building and automating the platform, I developed expertise in tools and technologies such as Ansible, Terraform, OpenStack, REST APIs, Git, and CI/CD pipelines with GitLab.

From 2022, I work as a DevSecOps Engineer, focusing on hardening cloud OS and container images through fully automated processes and developing scripts for security requirement checks.

Colleagues describe me as a self-driven and curious professional who thrives on learning new skills independently through documentation and online courses. I take pride in being a supportive team member, always ready to lend a hand.

Beyond Work
In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, traveling, reading sci-fi books, and exploring new skills on platforms like Udemy, Coursera, and CloudGuru. I‚Äôm passionate about open-source software and love experimenting with cooking. My curiosity and enthusiasm drive me to continuously discover and learn new things.
