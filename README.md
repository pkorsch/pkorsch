I was Database Administrator for more than 5 years with experience in Oracle Databases, MongoDB, and MySQL administration in Deutsche Telekom. My role has changed and evolved from classic operations to DevOps.

First years I mainly worked with Oracle databases in various environments (AIX, Solaris, Linux) until Deutsche Telekom decided to consolidate all oracle databases to one platform - Oracle Exadata - Oracle DBaaS.

Currently, I am DevOps Engineer and Tech Lead of the team responsible for the MongoDB DBaaS platform for Deutsche Telekom. The system is built on the Open Telekom Cloud platform, which is cloud based on OpenStack. In a cloud environment, we are not responsible only for databases but also for the operating systems, storage, network, automation, etc. During the built-up and automation, I learned a lot of new skills like Ansible, Terraform, OpenStack, Git, working with MongoDB API, and using Gitlab with CI/CD pipelines. Those skills moved me to my current position.**
